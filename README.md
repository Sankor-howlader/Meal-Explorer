## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Meal Explorer runs directly in modern web browsers without any extra dependencies. For development purposes, it is recommended to use a code editor with live reload functionality, such as Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/meal-explorer.git cd meal-explorer


2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- Alternatively, run a live-reload server through your code editor to preview changes in real time.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** The application uses JavaScriptâ€™s Fetch API to request recipe data from the Meal API. The retrieved JSON data is processed to create dynamic recipe cards.
- **Category Filtering:** Recipes are grouped by category. Users can select a specific category to filter the displayed recipes.
- **Pagination:** Recipes are presented in a paginated layout, ensuring that even large sets of data remain easy to navigate.
- **Dynamic Modal Display:** Clicking on a recipe card opens a modal window that reveals in-depth details about the recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and images.
